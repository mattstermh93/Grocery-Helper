# shopping-carts

Interactive shopping game that helps a user add groceries to their shopping cart.

I made two versions - one that is object oriented with multiple functions, and the other with more lines of (somewhat) repeated code. This makes it easier to see how it started vs how I decided to complete it.

the ShoppingCartFinal.py is the final version
